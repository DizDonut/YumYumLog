# Welcome to the YumYumLog

# The Yum Yum Log is a Node based food tracking application that utilizes sequelize for ORM, express for routing, and handlebars for template views.

#The application allows users to register and choose a specific food track, set a consumption goal, and track that goal through a week.  It also allows a view of the 'community' of users, tracking progress and comparing results
